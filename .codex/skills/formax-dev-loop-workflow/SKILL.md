description: "Use when working on Formax code changes and you need a disciplined dev loop: keep a single mainline task, avoid scope drift, run only targeted tests (no coverage), avoid partial staging (MM), run review with `gpt-5.2` + `high` reasoning before commit, include an incremental optimization check, and keep commits small and reviewable."

# Formax Dev Loop (Mainline Discipline)

## Default loop (repeat per TODO item)

1) **Pick one mainline item** and finish it end-to-end before starting another.
   - If a new idea appears mid-flight, write it down in a backlog note and continue the mainline.

2) **Write/adjust tests first** to lock behavior (when feasible).

3) **Implement** the smallest change that satisfies the item.

4) **Incremental optimization check (required)**
   - After implementation, do a quick pass:
     - Is there newly-dead/unused logic introduced by this increment?
     - Is there a low-risk simplification that reduces branching/duplication?
   - If yes, include a **small** optimization in the same item (no scope drift, no behavior change).
   - If no, explicitly proceed without optimization.

5) **Run only targeted tests** (never `bun run test:coverage` unless explicitly asked).
   - Preferred: `bun run test -- <changed-test-files...>`
   - Helper (repo): `bun run test:changed`
     - Use default (staged only) for the commit you are about to make.
     - Use `bun run test:changed -- --all` only when you intentionally want staged + unstaged + untracked.

6) **Pre-commit hygiene**
   - Avoid partial staging (“MM” state). If needed, check with:
     - `bun run check:partial-stage`
   - Run review before every commit (required profile):
     - `codex review --uncommitted -c model="gpt-5.3-codex" -c model_reasoning_effort="high"`
   - Use a long command timeout for review runs:
     - In Codex tool calls: set `timeout_ms` to **at least 900000** (15 minutes), preferred **1200000** (20 minutes).
     - Do not use short default timeouts for review loops.
   - If review returns findings: fix -> re-run targeted tests -> re-run review.

7) **Commit**
   - Keep it small (2–4 files ideally, unless refactor forces more).
   - Prefer one concern per commit (tests + implementation together for that concern).

## Guardrails (Formax-specific)

- Do not fix unrelated failures mid-loop unless they block the mainline.
- If a command would usually be run with pipes/redirections for convenience, prefer running it plain and rely on Formax’s own output truncation/Expand UI.
- Don’t “clean up” formatting/copy/colors/spacing unless explicitly requested or required for parity.

## Quick commands

```bash
# Detect partial staging (“MM”)
bun run check:partial-stage

# Run related tests for staged changes
bun run test:changed -- --dry-run
bun run test:changed

# Include unstaged + untracked (when explicitly intended)
bun run test:changed -- --all

# Required before commit (review profile)
codex review --uncommitted -c model="gpt-5.3-codex" -c model_reasoning_effort="high"

# If your shell supports it, wrap with an explicit process timeout (20 minutes)
timeout 1200 codex review --uncommitted -c model="gpt-5.3-codex" -c model_reasoning_effort="high"
```
